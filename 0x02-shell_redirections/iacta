I get wings to fly
Oh, oh, I'm alive
Yeah
When you call on me
When I hear you breathe
I get wings to fly
I feel that I'm alive
When you look at me
I can touch the sky
I know that I'm alive
When you bless the day
I just drift away
All my worries die
I'm glad that I'm alive
You've set my heart on fire
Filled me with love
Made me a woman
On clouds above
I couldn't get much higher
My spirit takes flight
Cause I am alive, 
When you call on me
When I hear you breathe
I get wings to fly
I feel that I'm alive
When you reach for me
Raising spirits high
That I'll be the one standing by
Through good and through trying times
And it's only begun
I can't wait for the rest of my life
